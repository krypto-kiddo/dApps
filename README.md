# NFT Minter
This is a project in a very initial stage, currently its mostly stuff from Alchemy's NFT Minter tutorial: https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/nft-minter

This is to be combined with two more modules further to make the complete application. 

# ðŸªœ Installation
To use this minter, you'll need to do the following:

1. Run `npm install` to download the `node_modules` folder.
2. Download the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) in your project directory by running `npm install dotenv --save` in your terminal

4. Run `npm start`in your terminal to open the minter in your browser at http://localhost:3000/.
