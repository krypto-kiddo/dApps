# Hello Folks
This is a project in a very initial stage, currently its mostly stuff from Alchemy's NFT Minter tutorial: https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/nft-minter

This is to be combined with two more modules further to make the complete application. 

# 🪜 Installation
To use this minter, you'll need to do the following:

1. Run `npm install` to download the `node_modules` folder.
2. Download the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) in your project directory by running `npm install dotenv --save` in your terminal
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory this `nft-minter` by entering the following on your command line: `vim .env` and then add your [Alchemy API Key](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/tutorials/nft-minter#create-your-alchemy-api-key) and [Pinata Key and Secret](https://pinata.cloud/keys). Altogether, your `.env` file should look like so:

```
REACT_APP_PINATA_KEY = <pinata-key>
REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET = <pinata-secret>
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_KEY = https://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/<alchemy-key>
```
4. Run `npm start`in your terminal to open the minter in your browser at http://localhost:3000/.
